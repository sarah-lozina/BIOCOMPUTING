The folder structure I created is good for reproducible research because all of my commands and steps are documented in the README.md file. If I were to redo the assignment, I could generate the exact same output by following my documented commands. Additionally, my comments make the code more readable and understandable. This structure will be helpful in the future for identifying and fixing bugs, as well as revising my code. This file structure will be beneficial in the future to hold my documenting accountable especially for assignments and group projects.

In bioinformatics, documented code is essential because it allows researchers to retrace the steps taken to analyze data. Proper documentation makes it easier to detect errors, including silent errors that might otherwise go unnoticed, and ensures that analyses can be reproduced. If the experiments are not capable of being reproduced, then no new knowledge can be surmised. 

Bioinformatics is the perfect blend of my neuroscience and data science majors. I have always wanted to explore bioinformatics and determine how it overlaps or is distinct from neuroscience and data science. This course allows me to accomplish what I set out to do when I declared my data application track: take courses that align with my interests and provide me with a deep toolbox I can use long after I graduate! I aim to pursue a career in neurological research, and this course will be directly applicable and a great introduction to research I could be doing. 

My data science and computer sciences courses have taught me to extensively comment on my code and format it in a way balances making sense to me and being in the preferred format of the instructor. Additionally, following along in class taking diligent notes so that I can understand what every line of code means in order to build off of it on my own. My neuroscience course have taught me to understand the small details and also think of the bigger picture. I know that my experience with both disciplines will assist me with thinking beyond the code and asking why we are doing something. 

My goals for this course are to expand my data skills and add new tools to my toolkit. I have several years of experience coding in Python and R at W&M, but I have always wanted to learn how to use the terminal. This semester, I aim to become comfortable with the terminal and gain experience analyzing large datasets. Coding can still feel intimidating at times, and I believe this class will help me build confidence and strengthen my ability to wrangle data effectively. I also want to become more comfortable asking questions, whether out of curiosity or troubleshooting. This is something I tend to avoid, which can lead to unnecessary stress and lost time. Furthermore, I intend to use this course as a litmus test for my interest in computational biological methods. I have conducted cognitive and neurodegenerative research, but have not extensively applied my coding abilities to neurobiological research. 

My plan for learning this semester includes cleaning up my notes after each class, maintaining tables of flags, special characters, and Unix commands, and regularly practicing tasks. I chose this course because I was interested in the content and because I like to challenge myself to learn new things and expand my toolbox. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester!
